# Weather Stations
A weather station is a location where meteorological data is measured. Most countries operate public weather station networks in order to monitor weather and climate. This repository provides a list of public weather stations everyone can contribute to. The data is maintained by meteostat and mirrored to GitHub daily.
## List of Weather Stations
The stations.csv file provides a list of all weather stations.
## Contributing
